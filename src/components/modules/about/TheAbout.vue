    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring software developer that grows and sells carnivorous plants.  This started as a hobby and quickly turned into a business.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>As a child, my aunt brought me a venus flytrap back from a trip to South Carolina.  I quickly proceeded to kill it, not knowing how to care for it, nor putting in the effort to learn.  However, this VFT did not die in vain.  It sparked an itch in me that I have spent 14 years scratching.</p>
