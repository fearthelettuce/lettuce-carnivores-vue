    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring software developer that grows and sells carnivorous plants.  This started as a hobby and quickly turned into a business.</p>

    <h3>About this site</h3>
        <p>I built this site to pracice my front-end software development skills.  I wanted to address some of the frustrations I've seen with other CP sites... showing hundreds of plants with 95% out of stock, having broken product filters, and general clunkiness.  I hope you have a great experience in using this site, and if not, I hope you let me know how I can improve it. </p>
    <h3>My introduction to carnivorous plants</h3>
    <p>As a child, my aunt brought me a venus flytrap back from a trip to South Carolina.  I quickly proceeded to kill it, not knowing how to care for it, nor putting in the effort to learn.  However, this VFT did not die in vain.  It sparked an itch in me that I have spent 14 years scratching.</p>
