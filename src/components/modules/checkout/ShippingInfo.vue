    <h4>What to expect when your package arrives</h4>
    <p>We proudly use compostable or repurposed packing materials for nearly all orders. Even the tape is compostable! </p>
    <h5>Adapting to your conditions</h5>
    <p>Please review our Care page to see our recommended conditions. Many plants are adaptable to different conditions if done properly.</p>
    <p>Bag acclimation method: if your humidity is significantly lower than our recommendations, we recommend placing the plant in a ziploc bag.  Cut 2-3 1/4" holes in the bag every 1 or 2 days.  Remove the bag after 2 weeks. This reduces the humidity gradually, allowing the plant to slowly acclimate to your specific conditions.</p>
    <p>A loss of turgor pressure (the pressure within the leaf/pitcher caused by water in the plant - think wilted lettuce vs fresh, crisp lettuce), especially in more than one leaf/pitcher, is major cause for concern.  If not already using the bag acclimation method, water and bag the plant immediately.  If you are already using the bag method, replace the bag with a new one and restart the process.</p>
    <h6>Watering</h6>
    <p>We grow Heliamphora and Nepenthes in a highly draining media that does not wick.  If you plant to water with a wicking method, such as the "tray method", you need to repot the plant into a mix that uses sphagnum or peat</p>
    <h5>Damage during shipping</h5>
    <p>While rare, damage during shipping if a fact of life. If a package arrives damaged, please take photos and contact us immediately.</p>
    <h6>Heliamphora and Cephalotus</h6>
    <p>In most cases, damage such as a 1-3 broken or crushed pitchers or broken nectar spoons is not threatening to the health of the plant.</p>
    <p>If the plant comes out of the pot during shipping, severe damage could occur.</p>
    <h6>Nepenthes</h6>
    <p>Damage to leaves and pitchers is not normally cause for concern, especially with large plants.</p>
    <p>If the growth tip is damaged or broken off, that is a major cause for concern. Please contact us immediately</p>
    
    <h5>Lost Packages</h5>
    <p>For standard shipping, we typically use USPS Ground Advantage.  Most packages arrive in 2-5 business days, but in some instances it can take up to 10 days.  If the package doesn't show any progress for several days, please contact us to discuss next steps.</p>
