For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the <b>Growth</b> tab in Seller Hub.</p> <p>There are two ways to add items to markdown promotions:</p> <ul><li><b>Key-based promotions</b> select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote.

Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.</li></ul>  <p>New promotions must be created in either a <code>DRAFT</code> or a <code>SCHEDULED</code> state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the <b>Location</b> response header.
