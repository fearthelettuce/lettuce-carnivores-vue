        <h4>Plants</h4>
        <p>We specialize in making mature Heliamphora widely available in the US market. Unlike imported tissue culture plants, the plants you will buy from me are generally established, actively growing, divisions that won't take years to grow to a decent size.</p>

            <h4>Live Arrival Guarantee and Return policy</h4>
            <p>Plants are guaranteed to arrive alive and in reasonable condition.  In this case, reasonable condition means that 75% of the plant is undamaged, and that damage does not threaten the health of the plant. For example, if the growth point of a nepenthes is broken off, that plant has a high likelyhood of dying and that would qualify for a refund. A heliamphora that arrives with some damaged pitchers would not qualify for a refund, unless the main growth point of the plant was damaged. </p>
            <p>To qualify for a refund under the Live Arrival Guarantee, you must contact dangerlettucecarnivores@gmail.com or DangerLettuce on Instagram/Facebook within 16 hours of the delivery time.  Photos of the package and plant showing the damage must be provided</p>
            <p>Since time in the mail can be stressful for the plants, returns are generally not accepted except as described above.</p>
            <h4>Order Cancellation Policy</h4>
            <p>I will make an attempt to accommodate all cancellation requests up until the time the printing label is created. Many orders are shipped same-day, so please contact us immediately if you have a concern. </p>
            <h4>Delayed Shipping Policy</h4>
            <p>I am happy to accommodate reasonable delayed shipping requests.  Ideally, please contact us before you make your purchase, but as with cancellations, I will make an attempt up until the time the shipping label is created. </p>
            <h4>Shipping</h4>
            <p>Plants are shipped within 2 business days.</p>
            <h4>Exports</h4>
            <p>Live plants are sold in the US only and cannot be exported.  Orders placed with a shipping address outside the US will be cancelled.</p>
